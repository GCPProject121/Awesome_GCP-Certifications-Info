# Study Plan

To learn the technologies to become a Google Cloud Architect you need to become familiar with the products and services offered by the platform. Not only that you will need an understanding of application development using the following methodologies:

* Monolithic application design (the old way).
* Database and other storage technologies (blob stores etc).
* Container based development and deployment.
* Microservices architecture.
* Serverless architecture.
* Application supporting technologies such as message queues etc.

The reason for using or not using the design components in the above list is not part of this study plan.
